         This variable is the age of onset for dementia and was assigned if a subject was
         assigned a diagnosis of dementia based on the initial assessment (in section AD)
         or at the follow-up assessment (in section BD).  Onset is the age at which we
         estimate that the individual met DSM criteria for dementia based on review of
         the chronological history of cognitive and functional symptoms.  This
         information is based
         primarily on informant report.

         The CDR quantifies severity of dementia in several different areas of
         functioning.  The CDR reflects an indirect evaluation of cognition and
         functional performance based on information obtained from both the informant and
         subject during the course of the evaluation.  The CDR rating was assigned for
         all subjects, regardless of dementia status.  More information about the CDR and
         how scores were assigned can be found in the data description.

         The Blessed Dementia Rating Scale - CERAD is a standardized research instrument
         that characterizes performance of activities of daily living that are often
         affected by dementia.  The informant was instructed to rate whether the subject
         had no loss, some loss or severe loss of ability in a number of areas of
         cognition and everyday activities.  For three items assessing activities of
         daily living (i.e., eating, dressing, toileting), the informant reported the
         level of assistance the subject needed on a three-point scale. For all items,
         the informant also noted whether the loss of ability or the need for assistance
         in each area was due to Mental (i.e. cognitive) and/or Physical reasons.  The
         score is weighted based on the severity of the loss.  The only items counted in
         the score are losses for which the cause is 'Mental' or 'Both' (Mental and
         Physical).  More information about this scale and how scores were assigned can
         be found in the data description.
