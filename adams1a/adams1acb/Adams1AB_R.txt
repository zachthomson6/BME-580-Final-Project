         The CIDI-SF is a brief self-report of depressive symptomatology that may be used
         to estimate probable diagnosis of a Major Depressive Episode (MDE).  The CIDI-SF
         has been previously used in the third wave of interviews for HRS and the second
         wave for AHEAD.  The CIDI-SF elicits information relating to symptoms and
         duration of MDE as spelled out in the Revised 3rd edition of the Diagnostic and
         Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III-R).  Please see the HRS

         Measure: NPI - NEUROPSYCHIATRIC INVENTORY
         Introduction: Now I'm going to ask you some questions about [NAME's] behavior. 
         I have to ask the questions exactly as they're written.  I also am only
         interested in behaviors you have seen in the past month.  In other words, if
         it's something you saw 6 months ago but not in the last month, it doesn't count.
          The questions can usually be answered 'yes' or 'no' so please try to give me
         brief answers. 
         
         A.  Delusions
         In the last month, has (NAME) had beliefs that you know are not true?  For
         example, insisting that people are trying to harm (HIM/HER) or steal from
         (HIM/HER).  Has (HE/SHE) said that family members are not who they say they are
         or that the house is not (HIS/HER) home?  I'm not asking about mere
         suspiciousness; I am interested if (NAME) is convinced that these things are
         happening to (HIM/HER).

         For a description of the NPI, response categories, and information regarding how
         the measure was completed, please refer to the data description.
