         Now we want you to remember what your friend or relative was like two years ago
         and to compare that with what he/she is like now. Below are situations where
         your friend or relative has to use his/her memory or intelligence, and we would
         like you to indicate whether this has improved, stayed the same, or gotten worse
         in each situation over the past two years.  Note the importance of comparing
         his/her present performance with two years ago.  So if two years ago your friend
         or relative always forgot where things were left, and he/she still does, then
         this would be considered "not much change."

         We are interested in learning about two types of care that people may provide to
         individuals with a health or memory problem.  In the questions below, "active
         help" means tasks that you might perform such as helping your friend or relative
         get across a room, cooking meals for him/her, or helping him/her with financial
         matters.  The other type of care, "supervision," means staying nearby your
         friend or relative to ensure his/her safety, to provide reassurance, or to make
         sure that nothing goes wrong.
         
         33. In the past month, have you provided care to your friend or relative by
         actively helping with any of the tasks in Question 30 or by supervising him/her
         to ensure safety, provide reassurance, or to make sure that nothing goes wrong?
