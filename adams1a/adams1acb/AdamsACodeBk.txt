         The CIDI-SF is a brief self-report of depressive symptomatology that may be used
         to estimate probable diagnosis of a Major Depressive Episode (MDE).  The CIDI-SF
         has been previously used in the third wave of interviews for HRS and the second
         wave for AHEAD.  The CIDI-SF elicits information relating to symptoms and

         Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III-R).  Please see the HRS

         Measure: NPI - NEUROPSYCHIATRIC INVENTORY
         Introduction: Now I'm going to ask you some questions about [NAME's] behavior. 
         I have to ask the questions exactly as they're written.  I also am only
         interested in behaviors you have seen in the past month.  In other words, if
         it's something you saw 6 months ago but not in the last month, it doesn't count.
          The questions can usually be answered 'yes' or 'no' so please try to give me
         brief answers. 
         
         A.  Delusions
         In the last month, has (NAME) had beliefs that you know are not true?  For
         example, insisting that people are trying to harm (HIM/HER) or steal from
         (HIM/HER).  Has (HE/SHE) said that family members are not who they say they are
         or that the house is not (HIS/HER) home?  I'm not asking about mere
         suspiciousness; I am interested if (NAME) is convinced that these things are
         happening to (HIM/HER).

         For a description of the NPI, response categories, and information regarding how
         the measure was completed, please refer to the data description.

         This variable is the age of onset for dementia and was assigned if a subject was
         assigned a diagnosis of dementia based on the initial assessment (in section AD)
         or at the follow-up assessment (in section BD).  Onset is the age at which we
         estimate that the individual met DSM criteria for dementia based on review of
         the chronological history of cognitive and functional symptoms.  This
         information is based
         primarily on informant report.

         The CDR quantifies severity of dementia in several different areas of
         functioning.  The CDR reflects an indirect evaluation of cognition and
         functional performance based on information obtained from both the informant and
         subject during the course of the evaluation.  The CDR rating was assigned for
         all subjects, regardless of dementia status.  More information about the CDR and
         how scores were assigned can be found in the data description.

         The DSRS is an informant-completed multiple-choice questionnaire that assesses
         severity of cognitive and functional impairment in domains that are typically
         affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD).  There are 12 items assessing the
         following domains: memory, orientation, judgment, social interactions/ community
         affairs, home activities/responsibilities, personal care, speech/language,
         recognition of others, feeding, incontinence, mobility/walking, and
         informant-perceived stress.  More information about this scale and how scores
         were assigned can be found in the data description.

         The Blessed Dementia Rating Scale - CERAD is a standardized research instrument
         that characterizes performance of activities of daily living that are often
         affected by dementia.  The informant was instructed to rate whether the subject
         had no loss, some loss or severe loss of ability in a number of areas of
         cognition and everyday activities.  For three items assessing activities of
         daily living (i.e., eating, dressing, toileting), the informant reported the
         level of assistance the subject needed on a three-point scale. For all items,
         the informant also noted whether the loss of ability or the need for assistance
         in each area was due to Mental (i.e. cognitive) and/or Physical reasons.  The
         score is weighted based on the severity of the loss.  The only items counted in
         the score are losses for which the cause is 'Mental' or 'Both' (Mental and
         Physical).  More information about this scale and how scores were assigned can
         be found in the data description.

         Q1.  DRUG NAME - code

         Respondents were mailed a medications form prior to the visit and asked to have
         this information available when the team arrived.  Information included names
         and dosages of prescription medication, vitamins/supplements, and other
         over-the-counter items taken in the previous two weeks.  At the time of the
         clinical assessment, the nurse examined all medication containers to confirm the
         medication information.
         
         The medication data was coded using Druglook, a computerized database developed
         at the Duke Aging Center by Joseph T. Hanlon, PharmD, MS and colleagues that
         assigns unique numeric codes to drugs.  Additionally, in the original database
         each code had a therapeutic category based on the condition or body system that
         it treated.  Over the past few years, the staff of the Duke Program in
         Epidemiology of Dementia and the Cache County Memory and Aging Study have
         assigned codes for newer medications and nutritional supplements.  Many of these
         newer codes have not had a therapeutic category code assigned to the

         Q4.  AT WHAT AGE DID (NAME) START TAKING (DRUG NAME)?

         For medical conditions that are treated episodically, but recur on a regular or
         frequent basis (e.g., allergies), AEAGE is recorded based on when the respondent
         first started using the medication regularly if he or she takes it "regularly"
         for long periods of time each year.  If the respondent takes a drug for an
         infection that he or she has taken before, but never regularly, AEAGE is coded
         for most recent course of medication (e.g., an antibiotic for an infection).

         Ref: DT1STR - DT30STR

         Q5.  STRENGTH - amount

         How much of a medication the respondent takes was calculated by multiplying
         strength, or amount, by how many doses were taken per time period specified. 
         This total amount may actually be taken as more than one dose of smaller
         amounts.  For drugs taken in different amounts on alternating days (e.g.,
         Coumadin), the total amount taken over a given time period was used to calculate
         the average daily or weekly dose.
         
         For example, for a medication taken in two doses of 5 mg. each per day, the
         total daily dose would be 5 mg. x 2 doses per day = 10 mg per day.  In the data
         set it would appear as AESTR=10, AEUNIT=2, and AEFREQ=1.
         
         For a medication taken in different doses on alternating days, e.g., two 25 mg.
         pills taken on one day and one 25 mg. pill taken on the alternate day, the daily
         dose was calculated as follows: (2 pills * 4 days) + (1 pill * 3 days) = 11
         pills per week * 25 mg. per pill = 275 mg. per week / 7 days per week = 39.3 mg.
         per day.  In the data set it would appear as AESTR=39.3, AEUNIT=2, an

         Now we want you to remember what your friend or relative was like two years ago
         and to compare that with what he/she is like now. Below are situations where
         your friend or relative has to use his/her memory or intelligence, and we would
         like you to indicate whether this has improved, stayed the same, or gotten worse
         in each situation over the past two years.  Note the importance of comparing
         his/her present performance with two years ago.  So if two years ago your friend
         or relative always forgot where things were left, and he/she still does, then
         this would be considered "not much change."

         things about family and friends, such as occupations, birthdays and addresses?

         individuals with a health or memory problem.  In the questions below, "active
         help" means tasks that you might perform such as helping your friend or relative
         get across a room, cooking meals for him/her, or helping him/her with financial
         matters.  The other type of care, "supervision," means staying nearby your
         friend or relative to ensure his/her safety, to provide reassurance, or to make
         sure that nothing goes wrong.
         
         33. In the past month, have you provided care to your friend or relative by
         actively helping with any of the tasks in Question 30 or by supervising him/her

         The Boston Naming Test is part of the CERAD test battery.  This test required
         the subject to name line drawings of common man-made and naturally occurring
         objects.  The total score is ANBNTTOT.  Additional information is provided in
         the data description.

         Measure: CONSTRUCTIONAL PRAXIS
         Whether the constructional praxis test was completed.

         The constructional praxis test in CERAD is adapted from Rosen's assessment of
         constructional praxis (Rosen, 1981), and tests the ability of the subject to
         copy four geometric forms of varying difficulty (circle, overlapping rectangles,
         diamond and cube).  The total score is ANCPTOT.  A delayed recall task is
         included in which the subject must draw from recall the four figures originally
         copied (ANDCPTOT).  This is followed by a recognition trial (ANRCPTOT) in which
         the subject must select each target figure out of an array that includes three
         non-target figures.

         This word list recall test is part of the CERAD test battery.  This task
         includes 10 high imagery words that are visually presented for 2 seconds each. 
         The subject read each word aloud as it is presented and then is tested on an
         immediate recall procedure.  There are 3 trials with immediate recall (ANIMMCR1,
         ANIMMCR 2, ANIMMCR3).

         If the subject was visually impaired or unable to read for other reasons (e.g.,
         illiterate), the word list may be read to the subject.  The subject was asked to
         repeat the words as they were read.  If this occurs, the “Can't read” field will
         be indicated (ANIMMNRD = 1).  A subject who was unable to correctly read more
         than three of the words was coded as being unable to read (ANIMMNRD = 5).

         After each of two brief stories were read to the subject, he or she was asked to
         recall as much of the story as possible.  The delayed recall task was
         administered later in the evaluation.  The code for the immediate trial is
         ANWM1TOT, and the code for the delayed trial is ANWM2TOT.

         The Fuld Object Memory Evaluation is based on recall of ten common household
         objects, which the subject first identifies by touch.  As per standard
         instructions, the subject was selectively reminded of items he or she did not
         recall.  Each recall trial was preceded by a distractor task requiring word
         generation.  The code for the total score is ANFULTOT.

         Whether the Symbol Digit Modality test was completed.

         The test requires the subject to substitute a number for randomized
         presentations of geometric figures.  A printed key is provided which pairs the
         Arabic numbers 1-9 with a specific symbol so that each number has its own unique
         symbol.  There are two methods of administration available, a written format and
         an oral format.  The preferred method of testing is the written form; however,
         for subjects who were untestable in this format (e.g., major motor impairment
         such as hemiparesis, Parkinsonism, etc.), the oral version was available for
         alternative administration.  Please see the variable ANSDMTYP to determine if
         oral administration occurred.  Users are advised against treating scores from
         written and oral administrations as equivalent.  The code for total correct is
         ANSDMTOT, and the code for errors committed is ANSDMERR.

         Digit Span includes separate tasks of both forward and backward repetition.  On
         both tasks, the examiner read a series of number sequences to the examinee.  For
         each Digits Forward item, the subject was required to repeat the number sequence
         in the same order as presented (code = ANDSSFT).  For Digits Backward, the
         subject was required to repeat the number sequence in the reverse order (code =
         ANDSSBT).  The code for the combined score of the forward and backward tasks is
         ANDSTOT.

         Whether the Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT) was completed.

         The Reading Recognition subtest of the Wide Range Achievement Test, 3rd edition
         (WRAT-3; Wilkinson, 1993) involves identifying letters and making correct
         pronunciation of a series of words.  There was no Spanish version of the WRAT-3,
         so it was not included in Spanish-language administrations.  The user should
         note that this test was added to the battery of tests after the ADAMS fieldwork
         began.  As a result, this instrument was not administered to all subjects.
